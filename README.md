## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get the application up and running on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- VS Code (recommended IDE)

### 1. **Clone the Repository (or create the project structure)**

If you're creating the project from scratch, ensure your folder structure matches the one described in "Project Structure" above.

If you were to clone, you would do:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AuthFlow.git   # Replace with your repo URL
cd AuthFlow
```

For your case, you already have the files, just ensure they are in the `UserAuthApp` directory as described.

### 2. **Set up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**

It's good practice to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory if not already there
cd UserAuthApp

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. **Install Dependencies**

With your virtual environment activated, install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install Flask bcrypt
```

### 4. **Create Database Tables**

The `app.py` script automatically creates the `users.db` file and the necessary `users` table when the application starts for the first time.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Ensure your virtual environment is activated.**
2. **Navigate to the `UserAuthApp` directory in your terminal.**
3. **Run the Flask application:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

4. **Access the Application:**

   Open your web browser and go to the address displayed in your terminal, typically:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```
